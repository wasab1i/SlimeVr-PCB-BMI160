# SlimeVr-PCB-BMI160
The project isn't tested! We are not responsable of any problems.

# what's special about it?
This is just a PCB for the one who don't really want to waste time soldering a lot of cables.

# What sensor does it work with?
It works with BMI160, the most good and cheap 

## Schematics
You can find all the files in the zip file

## purchase list: 
· D1 MINI  
· BMI160 
· 1N5817 diode × 2   
· 180K resistor   
· TP4056 charging module   
· 12D19 switch   
· 3.7v battery (903090 is preferred, you can use any 3,7 battery)   
· PH2.00 socket (This is for the extension, you can put it if you need it)

## Changelogs

Version 1.2:
Added pdf files if you want to do the pcb at home;
Added the Battery+ and Battery- texts;
Fixed some random texts;
Still not tested.

## What does it look like?

!ATTENTION!
If you see that the BMI160 is different, is becouse we used a placeholder different than the BMI itself, it changes only the design

The width is 91 and the height is 30

This one is for printing, so that you can use just one file for the extension and the pcb, the holes are for separating, the width is 112,6 the height 30

 
# Anything else to notice?
As official, the resistors and diodes in the PCB are optional. If you don't need battery detection, you can leave the resistor unsoldered; if you don't need to use slime while charging, you can connect the diode pad with tin, but i don't raccomand it.

# Is there any 3d case for this?
Not yet, i'm going to use a random plastic box

Big thanks for the help given by the project https://github.com/tianrui233/SlimeVR-PCB-KitKat

Sorry for gramm errors ;)

And Big Thanks to @pelide36, if it weren't for him, this project would never have existed (Follow him on Instagram >_<)
