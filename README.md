# SlimeVr-PCB-BMI160
The project isn't tested! We are not responsable of any problems.

# what's special about it?
This is just a PCB for the one who don't really want to waste time soldering a lot of cables.

# What sensor does it work with?
It works with BMI160, the most good and cheap 

## Schematics
You can find all the files in the zip file

## purchase list: 
· D1 MINI  
· BMI160 
· 1N5817 diode × 2   
· 180K resistor   
· TP4056 charging module   
· 12D19 switch   
· 3.7v battery (903090 is preferred, you can use any 3,7 battery)   
· PH2.00 socket (This is for the extension, you can put it if you need it)   
· PH2.00 cable (This is for the extension, you can put it if you need it)
## What does it look like?

!ATTENTION!
If you see that the BMI160 is different, is becouse we used a placeholder different than the BMI itself, it changes only the design

This one is for printing, so that you can use just one file for the extension and the pcb, the holes are for separating



 
# Anything else to notice?
As official, the resistors and diodes in the PCB are optional. If you don't need battery detection, you can leave the resistor unsoldered; if you don't need to use slime while charging, you can connect the diode pad with tin, but i don't raccomand it.

# Is there any 3d case for this?
Not yet, i'm going to use a random plastic box

Big thanks for the help gived by https://github.com/tianrui233/SlimeVR-PCB-KitKat

And sorry for gramm errors ;)

Big Thanks to @pelide36, if it weren't for him, this project would never have existed
